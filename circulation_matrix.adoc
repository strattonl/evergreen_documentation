= Understanding your Circulation Matrix

== What does the circulation matrix do?
The Circulation Matrix controls how items circulate: from which library, to which users, for how long, with how many renewals, and what fines they will generate. When an item is checked out or renewed, Evergreen scripts scan the Circulation Matrix to find the rule that best matches the item and patron being scanned.

The Circulation Matrix is created by translating library circulation policies - such as "Adult print books and audiobooks may be checked out for three weeks; if not returned by or on the due date, they will accrue overdue fines of $0.20 cents per day, to maximum of $5.00 until returned" - into codes, which are then combined into rules.
